'Punker' re-skin

---Model by Anderin---
 ---Skin by Senor---

This is a re-skin of the most popular player model ever released, Anderin's IRA. The model has been completely redone to work excellent with CS1.0 animations. The model was 100% redone from scratch so all credit goes to Anderin for that.

**Make sure to pick up the other 2 IRA skins if you don't already have them, 2 of the best for ever for CS.**

To use:
	Extract model into your half-life/cstrike/models/player/*
You can use this model in any one of the 8 model slots. Simply rename the model to the name of the folder, (eg: in terror folder rename "terror.mdl") and rename the original model you have in there for backup.

Enjoy!
