Glock28 HUD Sprite by Tiger 

1st off thank you for downloading the sprite and i hope u enjoy it and u are not disappointed by it in anyway :).

Installation is simple, extract the files 'w_glock18' & 'weapon_glock18' to your Counter-Strike folder usually..
C:\sierra\Half-Life\cstrike.
If you are already using a custom HUD.txt then you will have to change it manually, Scroll down to the 640 section (at the bottom) of your hud.txt and highlight d_mp5navy and all the numbers after it and copy/paste this over it all....

d_glock18			640 w_glock18	0	130	48	16

Save changes and ur ready to go!.
